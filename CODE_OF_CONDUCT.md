## ‚öñÔ∏è Humanity-First Alignment

Contributors must respect CI-AI‚Äôs core purpose:

- Sensitive domain outputs (medical, legal, financial) must be systemic, educational, or humanity-serving ‚Äî **never prescriptive**. 
- Contributions that undermine this principle will be rejected.

- Maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking action when violations occur. 
- Unacceptable behavior may result in warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the project community. 
- Major incidents will be logged publicly for transparency.
